# segments.yaml
#   - Describes how the facility CIDR block is allocated


# internal segments
#   - Format:
#             - name: <SEGMENT_NAME>
#               size: <CIDR_BLOCK_SIZE>
#   - Order matters - allocation starts at the address specified in facilities.yaml
#                   - script iterates through this list in order as it allocates the segments
#   - For intentionally allocated, but unused segments, but a '~' in front of the name
#       - The segment will be allocated, but the name will not be registered.
